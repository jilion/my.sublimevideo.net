## 1.2.2 (branch: 1.2.0-stable)

### Resolved Issues

## 1.2.1

### Resolved Issues

* \#63 `Database#collection_names` now returns collections with "system" in
  the name that aren't core MongoDB system collections. (Hans Hasselberg)

* \#62 Ensure `Connection#alive?` returns false if I/O errors occur. (lowang)

* \#59 Use the current database, not admin, for `getLastError` commands.
  (Christopher Winslett)

* \#57 Ensure collection name is a string for all operations.

* \#50 Fixed connection issues when connection is disconnected mid call.
  (Jonathan Hyman)

## 1.2.0

### New Features

* mongoid/mongoid\#2251 Allow `continue_on_error` option to be provided to
  inserts.

* mongoid/mongoid\#2210 Added `Session#disconnect` which will disconnect all
  nodes in the cluster from their respective database servers. Useful for cases
  where a large number of database connections are being created on separate
  threads and need to be explicitly closed after their work is completed.

* \#33 Added `Session#databases` and `Session#database_names` as a convenience
  for getting all database information for the server.

        session = Moped::Session.new([ "localhost:27017" ])
        session.database_names #=> [ "moped_test" ]
        session.databases #=> { "databases" => [{ "name" => "moped_test" }]}
