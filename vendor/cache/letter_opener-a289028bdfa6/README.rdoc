= Letter Opener

Preview email in the browser instead of sending it. This means you do not need to set up email delivery in your development environment, and you no longer need to worry about accidentally sending a test email to someone else's address.


== Rails Setup

First add the gem to your development environment and run the +bundle+ command to install it.

  gem "letter_opener", :group => :development

Then set the delivery method in <tt>config/environments/development.rb</tt>

  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener

Now any email will pop up in your browser instead of being sent. The messages are stored in <tt>tmp/letter_opener</tt>.


== Non Rails Setup

If you aren't using Rails, this can be easily set up with the Mail gem. Just set the delivery method when configuring Mail and specify a location.

  require "letter_opener"
  Mail.defaults do
    delivery_method LetterOpener::DeliveryMethod, :location => "tmp/letter_opener"
  end
