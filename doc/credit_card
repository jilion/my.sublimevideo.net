Nouvelle approche:

- Manual payments (update credit card & create/update site's plan) are done in the controllers
- Automatic recurrent payments are done in Site::Invoice

Credit Card manual authorization/payment:
- With 3-D Secure
- Without



3 Cases:
1 - Update credit card (CreditCardsController#update)
2 - Pay a plan on create (SitesController#create)
3 - Pay a plan on update (SitesController#update)

1 - CreditCardsController#update
ask for authorize credit cards info

if 3d secure needed
  inject html_answer (remember to create new routes for the 3ds callbacks)
else
  ok or not
end


2 - SitesController#create
create the site
create an invoice
try to charge the invoice (with the 3ds and paramplus with the new plan id flag if cc attributes present)

if 3d secure needed
  set the site to dev (will be updated once the 3ds form will redirect the user on the "success callback page", or "failed callback page"...)
  inject html_answer (remember to create new routes for the 3ds callbacks)
else
  if ok
    normal redirect
  else
    show errors
  end
end

3 - SitesController#update
update the site
create an invoice
try to charge the invoice (with the 3ds and paramplus with the new plan id flag if cc attributes present)

if 3d secure needed
  set the site to old plan (will be updated once the 3ds form will redirect the user on the "success callback page", or "failed callback page"...)
  inject html_answer (remember to create new routes for the 3ds callbacks)
else
  if ok
    normal redirect
  else
    show errors
  end
end
