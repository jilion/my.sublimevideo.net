We were trying to make a tablet version of our site and had to do the detection of the User Agent as well.\\n\\nFrom my understanding \xE2\x80\x9CAndroid\xE2\x80\x9D user agent name is a general User Agent term and will pick up all Android devices and treat them the same.\\nWe are probably detecting it completely differently than you, but this is what we have found.\\n\\nThe Android phones will pick up the \xE2\x80\x9Cmobile\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CAndroid\xE2\x80\x9D useragent. BUT, the tablets will only pick up the \xE2\x80\x9CAndroid\xE2\x80\x9D, you actually have to specify it to be \xE2\x80\x9CAndroid && !mobile\xE2\x80\x9D. Very odd. HERE is a linkhttp://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/12/android-browser-user-agent-issues.html to the Android developers blog about the Android \xE2\x80\x9Cmobile\xE2\x80\x9D vs no mobile/tablet issue that helped me out with my confusion about the Android tablet vs Android mobile user agent.\\n\\nHere is the full User Agent string for the Android tablet:\\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 3.0.1; en-us; Xoom Build/HRI66) AppleWebKit/534.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/ 534.13\\n\\n\\nAlso, we are using jQuery to make the multiple video/ interactive Thumbnails. We saw you guys use Prototype but our site is full of jQuery so there would be a conflict there. We have the multiple thumbnails working in all the main browsers(Firefox 3.5+, Chrome, Safari, IE9) except IE7/IE8.\\n\\nWe are only using m4v video format for ease of use. IE7/IE8 and Firefox run the Flash player but IE7/IE8 won\xE2\x80\x99t stop playing like Firefox will when the thumbnail is hit. HTML5 player pauses and the Flash player in Firefox, for some reason, stops playing and resets. That is cool with me if it does that, but IE7/IE8 Flash player just keep playing when the next video\xE2\x80\x99s thumbnail image is hit.\\nCan you, by chance, let me know of the stop or pause call to the Flash player via Javascript/jQuery?\\n\\nWe did start a plan with you guys.

Be sure the sublimevideo.ready() block is directly in your js file and not nested inside the jQuery's ready() handler. If the Chrome check passes, then add the \\\"sv_force_flash\\\" class to your <video> element(s)\\r\\n3) prepare your video by calling sublimevideo.prepare('my_video1') (where 'my_video1' is the \\\"id\\\" of your <video> element). If you have multiple videos and want to prepare all of them in one shot, you can either pass an array of \\\"id\\\"s to the prepare() method, or, within the sublimevideo.ready() block, you can add the \\\"sublime\\\" class to all of your <video>s and then call sublimevideo.preapre() with no arguments. You can read more about the prepare method at http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api#prepare\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope this helped. Please let me know if it didn't.

Taking in consideration we will bridge an agreement with a lot of records \\nlabel and musician from all genre's in Indonesia this will create a lot of \\ntraffic in the future and how to cope with this if wanting to use HTML 5 with \\nsublime?\\n\\nEach labels would have their line artist line up with their music video on our \\nsite. This would mean we need more than one player and pages showing and linking \\nto the their video. \\n\\nI hope by now you understand on my project undergoing here. Can you please \\nsuggests us in how to cooperate together in making our site works with the HTML \\n5 and sublime support. \\n\\nIf you are interested in talking further and discuss it through skype I would \\nlove to discuss more verbally with the sublime team.\\nMy account is revealoath (brillyanes sanawiri Indonesia)\\nPlease send us your suggestions and how what you think this project can go up \\nand running. \\n\\nThanks a Huge Lot\\nKind Regards,\\n\\nBrilly (brillyanes sanawiri)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________________________\\nFrom: \\\"info@sublimevideo.net\\\" <info@sublimevideo.net>\\nTo: Brilly <be.brilly@yahoo.com>\\nSent: Tue, May 10, 2011 10:36:43 PM\\nSubject: [SublimeVideo] Re: Info needed to start my project (#1159)\",\"type\":\"Comment\",\"attachments\":[],\"is_public\":true,\"author_id\":56993233}],\"ticket_field_entries\":[],\"submitter_id\":56993233,\"base_score\":90,\"latest_recipients\":null,\"due_date\":null,\"current_collaborators\":null,\"status_id\":1,\"description\":\"Hi Team Sublime,\\nI am undergoing a project for my website here in Indonesia. \\nI want to use the features that your team has developed for my website which \\nfirst of all I really think was great.\\nThe site works something like hulu (hulu.com) or vevo (vevo.com) \\nSo, my questions are these below:\\n\\n\\t1.
