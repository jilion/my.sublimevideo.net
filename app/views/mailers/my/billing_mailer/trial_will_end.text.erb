Thank you for taking the time to evaluate SublimeVideo! We hope you're enjoying your trial.

We'd just like to remind you that the <%= BusinessModel.days_for_trial - 1 %>-day free trial for <%= @site.hostname.presence || 'your site' %> expires in <%= pluralize(full_days_until_trial_end(@site), 'day') %> (on <%= l(@site.trial_end, format: :named_date) %>).

<% if @site.user.cc? %>
  Once the trial ends, we'll automatically charge your credit card <%= display_amount(@site.plan.price) %> for your <%= @site.plan.title %> plan.

  If you don't want to activate your paid plan, you can downgrade your site to the Free plan here:

  <%= edit_site_plan_url(@site.to_param, protocol: 'https', subdomain: 'my') %>
<% else %>
  Since we'll automatically begin charging you at the end of this trial, please make sure to register a valid credit card to prevent any charging issues. You can do this on the following page:

  <%= edit_billing_url(protocol: 'https', subdomain: 'my') %>
<% end %>

<% unless @site.user.billing_address_complete? %>
  Please make sure to also provide a valid billing address:

  <%= edit_billing_url(protocol: 'https', subdomain: 'my') %>
<% end %>
