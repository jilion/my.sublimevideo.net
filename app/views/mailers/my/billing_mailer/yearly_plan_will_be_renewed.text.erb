Your <%= @site.plan.name.titleize %> plan for <%= @site.hostname %> will be renewed in 5 days on <%= @formatted_renewal_date %>.

If you want to update your plan before this date, you can do it via the following link:

<%= edit_site_plan_url(@site, protocol: 'https', subdomain: 'my') %>

<% if @user.cc_expired? %>

Also, we noticed that your credit card has expired.

Please update your credit card information via the following link:

<%= edit_billing_url(protocol: 'https', subdomain: 'my') %>

<% elsif @user.cc_expire_this_month? %>

Also, we noticed that your credit card expires at the end of this month.

Please update your credit card information via the following link:

<%= edit_billing_url(protocol: 'https', subdomain: 'my') %>

<% elsif !@user.cc? %>

In order to prevent any charging issues, you'll need to provide valid credit card details before on <%= @formatted_renewal_date %> via the following link:</p>

<%= edit_billing_url(protocol: 'https', subdomain: 'my') %>

<% end %>
