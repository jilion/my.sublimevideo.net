  h3. Step 1: Add your site

  Log into #{link_to "MySublimeVideo", sites_url(subdomain: 'my')}, choose a plan and enter the domain of the site where you want to integrate SublimeVideo. This will generate a player that will only work on that site. For instance if you plan to have the player at _http://yourdomain.com/test/page.html_ you only need to enter _yourdomain.com_.

  *Notes:*
  * Your site's domain can be updated at any time.
  * You can share the same plan across all your subdomains via the "wildcard option":/site-settings#wildcard.
  * You can share the same plan across domains that are displaying or pointing to the *same content* as your main domain via the "staging and alias domains option":/site-settings#extra_domains.

  h3. Step 2: Embed the player's code

  Copy the SublimeVideo Player embed code for #{link_to "your site", sites_url(subdomain: 'my')} and paste it into the page where you plan to add your video(s). It's a single line of code that will load the player you've created in the previous step. We highly recommend you paste this line inside the @<head>@ tag[^"1":#fn-1^]:

:coderay
  #{coderay_options(:html)}
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>My website</title>
      <script src="http://cdn.sublimevideo.net/js/YOURTOKEN.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- Content of your website -->
    </body>
  </html>

:textile
  If you have multiple videos on the same page, you only need to add this line once.

  h3. Step 3: Add video

  For every video you want to add to your page, you need a "proper @<video>@ tag":/write-proper-video-elements with the @class@ attribute set to "_sublime_". When the page is loaded, the player will automatically look for all the @<video>@ elements with the "_sublime_" @class@ and take care of the rest. Here is how your @<video>@ element should look:

:coderay
  #{coderay_options(:html)}
  <video class="sublime" width="640" height="360" poster="video-poster.jpg" preload="none">
    <source src="http://yoursite.com/video.mp4" />
    <source src="http://yoursite.com/video.webm" />
  </video>

:textile
  Please read "how to write proper @<video>@ elements":/write-proper-video-elements to learn more about this.

  <div class="footnotes">
  #(#fn-1) If you want to put it elsewhere, please make sure it's before any @<video>@ element. This is necessary to ensure compatibility with old browsers that do not support HTML5.
  </div>
