  Existing customers of our paid plans may be wondering how the introduction of the new plans affects them.
  
  Don't worry - you've been automatically upgraded to the corresponding new plan.
  
  Not only do the new plans include more views, but we've also switched the metric used to measure your usage from _Video Pageviews_ (counted every time the page containing your video loads) to _Video Plays_ (*counted only when playback of your video starts*).
  
  Below are the full migration details for each plan:

  Your site plan has been upgraded to the new #{link_to "Free and unlimited plan", page_url('plans', subdomain: 'www')}. This allows you an unlimited monthly allowance of video plays.
