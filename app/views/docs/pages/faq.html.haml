  h2. Player FAQ

  h3. How can I customize the appearance of the initial play button?

  There is currently no built-in way of customizing the appearance of the initial play button. However, there is a pretty straightforward solution (using the JavaScript API) "documented here":/customizing-the-initial-play-button.

  h3. I have my video hidden, but it still shows up when the page loads, why?

  If your @<video>@ element is hidden (@display:none@) and you don't want it to be shown on page load, just do *not* add the "_sublime_" @class@ to it. To show the video, use the JavaScript API "(c)@sublimevideo.prepare@":/javascript-api/methods#prepare method.

  h3. Does SublimeVideo support streaming protocols?

  SublimeVideo currently only supports videos delivered through HTTP. This is because HTTP is currently the only protocol supported by HTML5 Video consistently on all browsers.

  RTMP support is something we plan to add in future, but it means our player will be forced into Flash mode, because HTML5 doesn't (and will probably never) support RTMP.

  h3. My site uses the HTTPS protocol, how can I embed SublimeVideo in it?

  SublimeVideo can be served via HTTPS, it requires to change the embed code you include in your pages. This is "documented here":/using-sublimevideo-on-ssl-sites.

  h2. Service FAQ

  h3. What are "video pageviews" and how are they counted?

  Video pageviews represent the number of times SublimeVideo player's code has been loaded.
  If you add the one-line player’s embed code to a page with some @<video>@ elements in it, the video pageviews count will be incremented every time the page is loaded/visited.
  The video pageviews count is incremented by 1 even if you have multiple videos on the page (because the player's code only needs to be downloaded once regardless of the number of videos you have on the page).
  Video pageviews are not counted if you don’t have any videos on the page.

  h3. Can I test SublimeVideo on _localhost_ or another development domain?

  Sure. By default SublimeVideo always works on _localhost_ and _127.0.0.1_. If you want to use a more specific development domain, please edit your "site settings":/site-settings. You can test the player on your local development domains with no limit: video pageviews will not be counted in this case.

  h3. I have multiple subdomains of my main domain, should I buy a separate plan for each one of them?

  No, you can share the same plan across all your subdomains via the "wildcard option":/site-settings#wildcard.

  h3. I have a staging domain, should I buy a separate plan for it?

  No, you can add your staging domain to the _staging and alias domains_ field. "Learn more":/site-settings#extra_domains.

  h3. I have different domains displaying or pointing to the same content, should I buy a separate plan for each of these?

  No, you can add these domains to the _staging and alias domains_ field. "Learn more":/site-settings#extra_domains.

  h3. Do you provide encoding and hosting for my video files?

  No, currently we provide the player – you keep full control of your video files by maintaining the flexibility of using your preferred encoding and hosting service(s).
