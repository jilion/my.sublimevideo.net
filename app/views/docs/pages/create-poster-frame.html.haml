  It's important that your poster frame has the same aspect ratio as your video file, or your viewers will see black bars appearing either above and below or on the sides of the player.

  "VLC":http://www.videolan.org/vlc is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player that allows you to easily take a snapshot of your video.

  To take a snapshot using VLC, simply open your MP4/H.264 video file, scrub to the timecode where you'd like to take a snapshot and Right-click -> Snapshot (or @ctrl+alt+s@ on Windows/Linux, @cmd+alt+s@ on Mac).

  #{image_tag('docs/create-poster-frame/vlc-snapshot.png', title: 'VLC snapshot')}

  All you need to do with the generated snapshot is rename it and resize it – using a simple image editing tool such as Paint (Windows), Preview (Mac) or "Gimp":http://www.gimp.org/downloads (Windows, Mac and Linux) – to the same dimensions as your video embed.
  Be sure to respect the video's aspect ratio when resizing the image.
