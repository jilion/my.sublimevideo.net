User acknowledges and agrees that the amount charged may vary from month to month due to the Usage fees incurred by User pursuant to its Plan. User authorizes Jilion to charge User's credit card for such varying amounts. All fees are payable in US dollars or any other currency selected by User when available on the "Billing information" section of the Website.
        ### *Charges period*. Jilion will charge User's credit card the applicable service usage fees identified in User's Order, once a month and every calendar month, on or around the day of the calendar month following the same day of the month in which such service usage fees (i) are incurred by User or (ii) the Order become effective pursuant to paragraph 3.3 herein ("Billing Period").

        ### *Locked Accounts for Payment Failure*.

        ### *Cancellations*. The monthly Usage fees for User's Plan will continue unless and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or cancelled pursuant to this section.

          #### *Cancellation by Jilion*. In addition to any other termination right Jilion has under these Terms and Conditions, Jilion may, with at least 30 days prior notice to User, cancel User's Order at any time in its sole discretion.

        ### *User's Credit Card Information*. User agrees that Jilion may share User's Order Information with third-party credit card processing companies for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of User's Order Information and processing and charging User's credit card for User's Order.
        ### *Changes to Fees and the Agreement*. With at least 30 days prior notice to User, Jilion may, in its discretion, change the terms (including the fees) and/or Entitlements of User's Plan. If User does not agree to such changes, User will have an opportunity to cancel or change its Order prior to such changes going into effect. If User does not cancel or change its Order within such time, User hereby acknowledges and agrees that its failure to cancel or change its Order shall constitute User's affirmative acceptance of the changes.
        ### *Penalty for late payments*. Late payments may be subject to fees at the rate of 1.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum rate allowed by law. If User fails to pay applicable fees when payment is due, then in addition to any other rights Jilion may have, Jilion shall have the right to suspend delivery of all or a portion of any Service or Hosting Service to User.
